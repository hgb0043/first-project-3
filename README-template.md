## Overview

This project is a simple application of HTML & CSS in order to create a clear and concise visual of a scannable qr-code with complementary text.

## My process

- Begin by creating the index.html file and opening the file to live server; this file will serve as the sole and primary HTML file for the project.

- Create a CSS file that will serve as the sole and primary CSS file for the project; I named mine styles.css. Link this CSS file into the index.html file.

- Create the general structure of the page in the index.html file by creating three div elements. The first two elements will become the black borders at the vertical edge of the page. The third element should be a flexbox that will hold all of the content of the page; give this div an id of "container."

-  The container div should contain three child div elements, all of which contain their own respective content. The first element should contain the qr-code itself and the second and third elements will contain the text under the qr-code. 

- Center the container div with respect to the entire page using the CSS declaration "position: fixed" and the translate property. Also, make the container div a columnal flexbox.

- Style the child elements of the container element by positioning them with flexbox. Adjust the size of the qr-code and text to make sure they roughly match the size of the finished screenshot I have linked.
Refer to the sytle-guide.md for colors, fonts, and layout help.

- Finally, if you would like, add an attribute to the bottom or top of the page. The styling here is not very important, just make sure it is sufficiently visible and not too big. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Traditional workflow 

### What I learned

I refined my ability to create a general structure using HTML and position objects using css. New features I learned in this project was the "translate" porpertywhich assists in centering large objects (as seen in the sample css code below) and how to create and appropriately style an attribution. Overall, even though this project was small, I found it very helpful because it provided a palatable level of new content while adding more crucial reps to the every-day process of programming. 

### Continued development

I could still use some work mastering styling using HTML and CSS. I have the basics down but it would be nice to hold a wider repertiore of content and develop and edit the code at a much faster pace.
